# Time-of-Flight_Vision_System


### *Objective*
The objective of this project is to estimate products' orientation and dimensions using a time-of-flight (ToF) camera. 
The project is made as a Robotics Engineering, Bachelor project and is made in collaboration with a warehouse logistics company.
The company has a solution that already performs this task, but since it is quit expensive and a closed second part system they would like to explore the possibility of using a ToF camera instead since its cheaper and they can customize the software themselve. 

### *How to get it running*
The camera used for this project is a ifm electronics O3D303 (https://www.ifm.com/gb/en/product/O3D303) and ifm provides a developer C++ library which is used in this project. This means that there are some step to be completed in order to be able to run the application in this repository.

1. Go to "https://github.com/ifm/ifm3d" and follow the installation guide that suits your system.
